# Electric Vehicle Analysis

This repository contains my first project using Tableau, focusing on the analysis of electric vehicles (EVs). The project leverages both Excel and Tableau to gather, clean, analyze, and visualize data to uncover key insights about the EV market.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Collection & Preparation:** 
  - Used Excel to gather and clean data from multiple sources.
  - Data preparation involved handling missing values, ensuring consistency, and structuring data for analysis.

- **Visualization with Tableau:**
  - Created interactive dashboards to visualize trends, market share, and adoption rates of electric vehicles.
  - Visualizations include charts, graphs, and interactive elements for detailed analysis.

- **Key Insights:**
  - Identified top manufacturers and popular EV models.
  - Projected growth trends in the EV sector based on historical data.
